## The purpose of this project is as follows:
This program procedurally creates individual org charts from Current Job Report from CUNYfirst.
## Here's some back story on why I needed to build this:
In order to effectively audit reporting structures, it becomes necessary to frequently solicit feedback from organizational leadership. it is easier to do this with images than columnar data. This program generates local reporting charts to aid in auditing.



The expected frequency for running this code is Monthly.
